# Facade
It's a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. Basically it extracts from the library (ies) only the method (s) that will be used.

## Relations With Other Patterns
`Facade` defines a new interface for existing objects, whereas `Adapter` tries to make the existing interface usable. `Adapter` usually wraps just one object, while `Facade` works with an entire subsystem of objects.
