# Iterator
It's a behavioral pattern that lets you traverse ("walk through") elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

Collection is just a container for a group of objects.

The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an `iterator`.
