# State
It's a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

This structure may look similar to the Strategy pattern, but thereâ€™s one key difference. In the State pattern, the particular states may be aware of each other and initiate transitions from one state to another, whereas strategies almost never know about each other.
